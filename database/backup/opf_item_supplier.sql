The transducer creates sinusoidal waves, which in turn cause cavitation—the formation and violent collapse of minute vacuum bubbles in the solution. These implosions thoroughly scrub every surface with which the solution makes contact, yet are not harsh on delicate items. Cleaners also feature “sweep” frequency that provides uniform cleaning throughout the tank by creating overlapping ultrasonic waves and eliminating inconsistent cleaning due to areas of intense ultrasonic activity.\n\nThe leakproof housing features super-sealing double O-rings and recessed ventilation. The 304 stainless steel (SS) tank is surrounded by a durable, impact-resistant polypropylene housing. Sealed membrane control panel is impervious to splashes and spills.\n\nUltrasonic Cleaners with Digital Timer, Power Tracking, Sleep Mode and Degas Feature\nFor critical cleaning applications up to 90 minutes or continuous operation. Our advanced digital models have the features needed to enhance control for those precision applications when required. Power tracking automatically adjusts to light or heavy loads by compensating for liquid level and temperature changes while maintaining the same ultrasonic power to the tank. Cleaners go into sleep mode once cycle is complete and no key has been touched for 15 minutes. The degas feature eliminates air bubbles from the solution for more efficient cleaning.\n\nFor the ultimate in critical cleaning these cleaners also feature an adjustable heater from 68 to 156°F (20 to 69°C) and a temperature sensor that prevents overheating. A high/low power feature lets you choose full power for ultimate cleaning or low (70%) for delicate applications. Auto ultrasonic activation turns the unit on once the set temperature is reached and starts timer countdown. Once cycle is complete, the heater and ultrasonics are turned off.\n\n',0,NULL),

Choose from one of three UV wavelengths or a combination of UV wavelengths or white light in 4-, 6- or 8-watt configurations. A basic lamp configuration of one UV and one white light tube is ideal for viewing materials in a dimly-lit area. Twin UV models offer two tubes of identical wavelength operating at the same time for added UV intensity. Double UV models with two different tubes allow you to work in any one of two ultraviolet wavelengths. The triple UV model, available only in the 8-watt lamp, allows you the flexibility to easily switch among the three wavelengths (shortwave, midrange, or longwave UV). A selector switch on the back of the lamp makes it simple to switch between light sources on models with multiple wavelengths.\n\n\nThe 365 nm longwave UV models are ideal for bacterial identification, specimen staining, gel electrophoresis, chlorination, fluorochemistry, and more. The 302 nm midrange UV models provide an effective tool for gel electrophoresis, gel viewing, and optical lab measurements. The 254 nm shortwave UV models can be used for biochemical testing, mercury detectors, optical alignment, DNA analysis, electrophoresis, and more.\n\nA viewing cabinet, for a darkroom environment, can be purchased for the 4- and 8-watt models. An optional lamp stand for hands-free operation is available for all models.\n\nLamps provide longwave, midrange, shortwave, or white light in a compact, economical design. The 4-watt model comes with two tubes. Basic configuration features one UV tube and one white light tube—for added illumination in dimly lit areas. A selector switch on the lamp back makes it easy to switch light sources. Twin-tube models use two tubes of the same wavelength for added UV intensity. Double-UV models use two tubes of different wavelengths.\nUse these 4-watt lamps with optional viewing cabinet 97620-70 for a darkroom environment.

Choose from one of three UV wavelengths or a combination of UV wavelengths or white light in 4-, 6- or 8-watt configurations. A basic lamp configuration of one UV and one white light tube is ideal for viewing materials in a dimly-lit area. Twin UV models offer two tubes of identical wavelength operating at the same time for added UV intensity. Double UV models with two different tubes allow you to work in any one of two ultraviolet wavelengths. The triple UV model, available only in the 8-watt lamp, allows you the flexibility to easily switch among the three wavelengths (shortwave, midrange, or longwave UV). A selector switch on the back of the lamp makes it simple to switch between light sources on models with multiple wavelengths.\n\n\nThe 365 nm longwave UV models are ideal for bacterial identification, specimen staining, gel electrophoresis, chlorination, fluorochemistry, and more. The 302 nm midrange UV models provide an effective tool for gel electrophoresis, gel viewing, and optical lab measurements. The 254 nm shortwave UV models can be used for biochemical testing, mercury detectors, optical alignment, DNA analysis, electrophoresis, and more.\n\nA viewing cabinet, for a darkroom environment, can be purchased for the 4- and 8-watt models.

The stills, constructed of borosilicate glassware coupled with silica-sheathed heaters enclosed in a protective cabinet, deliver pyrogen-free distillate of the highest purity from virtually any raw water supply. The condenser is designed to make sure droplets of distilled water remain in contact with the cooling coil for an extended period ensuring maximum energy transfer and production of cold distilled water for immediate use. All-glass construction allows for rapid descaling using strong mineral acids. The units can be safely and easily cleaned without dismantling the glassware. A large bore stopcock with PTFE key is fitted for easy draining of chemicals after cleaning. Safety features include flow sensor, overtemperature thermostat, acrylic screen, cabinet lid, and screw threads on all water connections.

The Premium range is also available in an unrivalled eight colour options.\n\nA simple clean body allows for any spillages to be easily deflected from the user. A spill-resistant front control module with chemically toughened glass, means you can clearly see what\'s going on without fear of cosmetic damage to the unit.\n\nThe mains independent \"Hot\" warning light will flash whenever the plate temperature is above 50°C even when the hotplate is turned off and unplugged from the mains.\nPowerful magnets and motor give stirring speeds up to 1400 rpm and are capable of mixing large volumes (up to 15 litres *).\n\nAll models have an integral fixing point for a retort rod and are supplied with 2 x 25mm PTFE coated stir bars.\n\nCeramic units offer excellent chemical resistance and are easy to clean. The thermal properties of a ceramic surface allow very high plate temperatures, while cool edges reduce the chance of accidental burns. The white surface ensures good visibility of colour changes, for titrations for example.\n\nCeramic coated Aluminium surfaces offer a robust top plate with excellent heat transmission. The top plate has a thin ceramic coating for added chemical resistance. A 700W element gives rapid heating and ensures even temperature distribution across the whole surface of the plate.\n\nPremium units offer the highest level of sophistication in a hotplate stirrer with a full colour 4\" TFT screen. Both set and actual temperature of the sample are displayed simultaneously.\nAs the hotplate heats the sample to the set temperature, the advanced control algorithm automatically measures the rate of temperature rise to judge the capacity and nature of samples (e.g. oil or aqueous). It then optimises the heating rate to minimize overshoot and time to set point.\n\nHotplate stirrers achieve the highest level of sample temperature uniformity, by combining the hotplate function with a stirring action, the sample mixing delivers enhanced temperature uniformity. Powerful magnets and motor give stirring speeds up to 1400 rpm and volumes up to 15 litres*. Set and actual stirring speed are displayed at all times, and thanks to the digital display of speed, experiment reproducibility is easy, as exactly the same speed can be programmed each time.\n\nThe Premium units bring the ability to create programs, controlling the temperature and stirring speed. Individual customer temperature and speed profiles can be created and saved to the unit, allowing for fast set up of complicated experimental procedures, without tying the user to the unit adjusting settings for a prolonged period of time.\n\nAll Premium units include a PTFE coated temperature probe, which when immersed within the sample, allows accurate sample temperature control to within ±1°C.\n\nPremium units are available in eight colour choices, Blue, Black, White, Red, Pink, Ultraviolet, Avocado and Tangerine.\n\nThe Premium units are future proof; with the built-in connectivity the units can be updated in the field, as and when new firmware versions are available.\n\n* Based on water contained in a 20 litre glass bottom boiling flask\nPlate material	Ceramic-coated Aluminium\nPlate dimensions, mm	150 x 150\nHeated area, mm	150 x 150\nHeater power, W	700\nDisplay resolution °C	1\nMax. plate temp. °C	300\nConnection for Ext. temperature sensor	Yes, Pt100 temperature sensor\nControl accuracy with probe °C	± 1°C\nHot warning light	Mains Independent\nProgrammable	Programmable stopstart and sinusoidal\nStirrer speed, rpm	50 to 1400\nMax. stirring capacity, litres	15\nAvailable colours	Blue, White, Black, Avocado, Red, Tangerine, Violet, Pink\nNet weight, kg	2.85 kg\nOverall dimensions (w x d x h)	180 x 300 x 93\nElectrical supply	115V or 230V, 5060Hz\n\n',0,NULL),
